// CSS code splitting: These styles are imported directly in their respective
// lazy-loaded components, so they get bundled separately for better performance.
// Do NOT add them back here - it would duplicate them in the main CSS bundle.

// @use 'for-owners-page';     → imported in ForOwnersPage.tsx
// @use 'how-it-works-page';   → imported in HowItWorksPage.tsx (if exists)
// @use 'security-page';       → imported in SecurityPage.tsx
// @use 'not-found-page';      → imported in NotFoundPage.tsx

// Only pricing-section is kept as it's used across multiple pages
@use 'pricing-section';
